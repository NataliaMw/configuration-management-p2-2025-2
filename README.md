# 🧩 Team Task Tracker - Collaborative Version Management with Git

## 📘 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Software Engineering II** course at **Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL)**.  
The objective of this workshop is to **practice collaborative software development** using **Git and GitHub**, applying version control, branching, merging, and conflict resolution in a simulated multi-developer environment.

The system is a simple **Team Task Tracker** that allows users to:
- View a list of tasks
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed

The project is divided into two parts:
- **Frontend:** Single-page web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Backend:** REST API (Node.js, Express)
